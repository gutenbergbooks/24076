<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h2>WOOL SILK COTTON AND LINEN</h2>


<p>WOOLS are of various kinds:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Highland, Welsh and Irish</i> wools are from small
sheep, not far removed from the wild state, with
irregular short stapled fleeces.</p>

<p><i>Forest or Mountain sheep</i> (Herdwick, Exmoor, Cheviot,
Blackfaced, Limestone) have better wool, especially the
Cheviot, which is very thick and good for milling.</p>

<p><i>Ancient Upland</i>, such as South Down, are smaller sheep
than the last named, but the wool is softer and finer.</p>

<p><i>Long Woolled sheep</i>, (Lincolns, Leicester) with long staple
wool (record length, 36".) and fleeces weighing up to 12&nbsp;lbs.
The Leicester fleece is softer, finer and better than Lincoln.</p>

<p>To the end of the 18th century <i>Spanish wool</i> was the
finest and best wool in the world. Spanish sheep have since
been introduced into various countries, such as Saxony,
Australia, Cape Colony, New Zealand; and some of the best
wools now come from the Colonies.</p>

<p><i>Alpaca, Vicuna and Llama</i> wools are from different
species of American goats.</p>

<p><i>Mohair</i> from the Angora goat of Asia Minor.</p>

<p><i>Kashmir Wool</i> from the Thibetan goat.</p>

<p><i>Camel</i> hair, the soft under wool of the camel, which is
shed annually.</p>

<p>The colour of wool varies from white to a very dark
brown black, with all shades of fawn, grey and brown in
between. The natural colours are not absolutely fast to
light but tend to bleach slightly with the sun.</p>

<p>The principal fleeces are:</p>

<p><i>Lambs</i>, 3 to 6 months growth, the finest, softest and
most elastic wool.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Hogs and Tegs</i>: the first shearing of sheep that have not
been shorn as lambs.</p>

<p><i>Wethers</i>: all clips succeeding the first shearing.</p>

<p>Wool comes into the market in the following condition.
1. <i>In the grease</i>, not having been washed and containing all
the impurities. 2. <i>Washed</i>, with some of the grease removed
and fairly clean. 3. <i>Scoured</i>, thoroughly cleaned and all
grease removed.</p>

<p>Wool can be dyed either in the fleece, in the yarn, or
in the woven cloth. Raw wool always contains a certain
amount of natural grease. This should not be washed out
until it is ready for dyeing, as the grease keeps the moth
out to a considerable extent. Hand spun wool is generally
spun in the oil to facilitate spinning. All grease and oil
must be scoured out before dyeing is begun, and this must
be done very thoroughly or the wool will not take the colour.</p>

<h4>WATER</h4>

<p>A constant supply of clean soft water is an absolute
necessity for the dyer. Rain water should be collected as
much as possible, as this is the best water to use. The dye
house should be by a river or stream, so that the dyer can
wash with a continuous supply. Spring and well water is, as
a rule, hard, and should be avoided. In washing, as well as in
dyeing, hard water is injurious for wool. It ruins the brilliancy
of the colour, and prevents the dyeing of some colours.
Temporary hardness can be overcome by boiling the water
(20 to 30 minutes) before using. An old method of purifying
water, which is still used by some silk and wool scourers, is to
boil the water with a little soap, skimming off the surface as
it boils. In many cases it is sufficient to add a little acetic
acid to the water.</p>

<h4>TO WASH WOOL</h4>

<p>In a bath containing 10 gallons of warm water add 4 fluid
ounces of ammonia fort, .880, 1&nbsp;lb. soda, and 2&nbsp;oz. soft soap,
(potash soap). Stir well until all is dissolved. Dip the wool in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
and leave for 2 minutes, then squeeze gently and wash in
warm water until quite clear.</p>

<p><i>Or</i> to 10 gallons of water add 6&nbsp;oz. ammonia and 3&nbsp;oz.
soft soap. The water should never be above 140&deg;F. and all
the washing water should be of about the same temperature.</p>

<p>Fleece may be washed in the same way, but great care
should be taken not to felt the wool&mdash;the less squeezing
the better.</p>

<p>There are four principal methods of dyeing wool.</p>

<p>1st.&mdash;The wool is boiled first with the mordant and
then in a fresh bath with the dye.</p>

<p>2nd.&mdash;The wool is boiled first with the dye, and when
it has absorbed as much of the colour as possible the mordant
is added to the same bath, thus fixing the colour.</p>

<p>A separate bath can be used for each of these processes,
in which case each bath can be replenished and used again
for a fresh lot of wool.</p>

<p>3rd.&mdash;The wool is boiled with the mordant and dye in
the same bath together. The colour, as a rule, is not so
fast and good as with a separate bath, though with some
dyes a brighter colour is obtained.</p>

<p>4th.&mdash;The wool is mordanted, then dyed, then mordanted
again. This method is adopted to ensure an extremely
fast colour. The mordant should be used rather sparingly.</p>


<h3>SILK</h3>

<p>There are two kinds of silk (1) <i>raw silk</i> (reeled silk,
thrown silk, drawn silk), and (2) <i>waste silk</i> or spun silk.</p>

<p>Raw silk is that directly taken from the cocoons. Waste
silk is the silk from cocoons that are damaged in some way
so that they cannot be reeled off direct. It is, therefore, carded
and spun, like wool or cotton.</p>

<p>Silk in the raw state is covered with a silk gum which
must be boiled off before dyeing is begun. It is tied up in
canvas bags and boiled up in a strong solution of soap for
three or four hours until all the gum is boiled off. If it is a
yellow gum, the silk is wrought first in a solution of soft soap<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
at a temperature just below boiling point for about an hour,
then put into bags and boiled. After boiling, the soap is well
washed out.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, the affinity of silk for dyes is similar
but weaker in character to that of wool. The general method
for dyeing is the same as for wool, except, in most cases, lower
temperatures are used in the mordanting. In some cases,
soaking in a cold concentrated solution of the mordant is sufficient.
The dyeing of some colours is also at low temperature.</p>


<h3>COTTON</h3>

<p>Cotton is the down surrounding the seeds in pods of
certain shrubs and trees growing in tropical and semi-tropical
countries. First introduced into Europe by the Saracens, it
was manufactured into cloth in Spain in the early 13th
century. Cotton cloth was first made in England in the
early 17th century.</p>

<p>The colour of cotton varies from deep yellow to white.
The fibre differs in length, the long stapled being the most
valued. It is difficult to dye and requires a special preparation.</p>

<p>A few of the natural dye stuffs are capable of dyeing
cotton direct, without a mordant, such as Turmeric,
Barberry bark, safflower, annatto. For other dyes cotton has
a special attraction, such as catechu.</p>


<h3>LINEN</h3>

<p>Linen is flax, derived from the decomposed stalks of a
plant of the genus Linum.</p>

<p>It grows chiefly in Russia, Belgium, France, Holland
and Ireland. The plants after being gathered are subjected
to a process called "retting" which separates the fibre from
the decaying part of the plant. In Ireland and Russia this is
usually done in stagnant water, producing a dark coloured
flax. In Belgium, Holland, and France, retting is carried
out in running water, and the resulting flax is a lighter
colour. Linen is more difficult to dye than cotton, probably
on account of the hard nature of the fibre. The same
processes are used for dyeing linen as for cotton.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p><i>To Bleach Linen</i>&mdash;(For 13 to 15 yards linen). Boil 1/2&nbsp;lb.
soap and 1/2&nbsp;lb. soda in a gallon of water. Put it in a copper
and fill up with water, leaving room for the linen to be put
in. Put in the linen and bring to the boil. Boil for 2 hours,
keeping it under the water and covered. Stir occasionally.
Then spread out on the grass for 3 days, watering it when
it gets dry. Repeat this boiling and grassing 3 weeks. The
linen is then pure white.</p>

<p><i>To bleach linen a cream colour</i>&mdash;Boil 1/2&nbsp;lb. soap and 1/2&nbsp;lb.
soda in a gallon of water. Fill copper up with water and
put in linen. Boil for 2 hours. Repeat this once a day for
4 days. The linen should not be wrung out but kept in the
water till ready to be put into the fresh bath.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h2>MORDANTS</h2>


<p>Any dye belongs to one of two classes. <i>Substantive</i>,
giving colouring directly to the material: and
<i>adjective</i>, which includes the greater number of dyes
and requires the use of a mordant to bring out the colour.</p>

<p>There are thus two processes concerned with the dyeing
of most colours; the first is mordanting and the second is
the colouring or actual dyeing. The mordanting prepares
the stuff to receive the dye (<i>mordere</i>, <i>to bite</i>).</p>

<p>The early French dyers thought that a mordant had the
effect of opening the pores of the fibre, so that the dye could
more easily enter; but according to Hummel, and later dyers,
the action of the mordant is purely chemical; and he gives
a definition of a mordant as "the body, whatever it may be,
which is fixed on the fibre in combination with any given
colouring matter." The mordant is first precipitated on to
the fibre and combines with the colouring matter in the
subsequent dye bath. But, whether the action is chemical
or merely physical, the fact remains that all adjective dyes
need this preparation of the fibre before they will fix themselves
on it. The use of a mordant, though not a necessity, is
sometimes an advantage when using substantive dyes.</p>

<p>In early days the leaves and roots of certain plants were
used. This is the case even now in India and other places
where primitive dyeing methods are still carried on. Alum
has been known for centuries in Europe. Iron and tin filings
have also been used. Alum and copperas have been known
in the Highlands long ages.</p>

<p><i>Mordants</i> should not affect the physical characteristics of
the fibres. Sufficient time must be allowed for the mordant
to penetrate the fibre thoroughly. If the mordant is only
superficial, the dye will be uneven: it will fade and will not
be as brilliant as it should be. The brilliancy and fastness of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
Eastern dyes are probably due to a great extent to the length
of time taken over the various processes of dyeing. <i>The longer
time that can be given to each process, the more satisfactory
will be the result.</i></p>

<p>Different mordants give different colours with the same
dye stuff. For example:&mdash;Cochineal, if mordanted with
alum, will give a crimson colour; with iron, purple; with
tin, scarlet; and with chrome or copper, purple. Logwood,
also, if mordanted with alum, gives a mauve colour; if
mordanted with chrome, it gives a blue. Fustic, weld, and
most of the yellow dyes, give a greeny yellow with alum,
but an old gold colour with chrome; and fawns of various
shades with other mordants.</p>

<p>Silk and wool require very much the same preparation
except that in the case of silk, high temperatures should be
avoided. Wool is generally boiled in a weak solution of
whatever mordant is used. With silk, as a rule, it is better to
use a cold solution, or a solution at a temperature below
boiling point. Cotton and linen are more difficult to dye
than wool or silk. Their fibre is not so porous and will not
hold the dye stuff without a more complicated preparation.
The usual method of preparing linen or cotton is to boil it
first with some astringent. The use of astringents in dyeing
depends upon the tannic acid they contain. In combination
with ordinary mordants, tannic acid aids the attraction of
the colouring matter to the fibre and adds brilliancy to the
colours. The astringents mostly used are tannic acid, gall nuts,
sumach and myrobalams. Cotton has a natural attraction for
tannic acid, so that when once steeped in its solution it is not
easily removed by washing.</p>


<h3>ALUM</h3>

<p>This is the most generally used of all the mordants, and
has been known as such from early times in many parts of
the world. For most colours a certain proportion of cream
of tartar should be added to the alum bath as it helps to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
brighten the ultimate colour. The usual amount of alum
is a quarter of a pound to a pound of wool. As a rule, less
mordant is needed for light colours than for dark. Excess of
alum is apt to make the wool sticky. The usual length of
time for boiling is about an hour. Some dyers give as much
as 2-1/2 hours.</p>

<p><i>Example of mordanting with alum</i>&mdash;1/4&nbsp;lb. of Alum and
1&nbsp;oz. cream of tartar for every pound of wool. This is dissolved
and when the water is warm the wool is entered. Raise to
boiling point and boil for one hour. The bath is then taken
off the fire and allowed to cool over night. The wool is then
wrung out (not washed) and put away in a linen bag in a cool
place for 4 or 5 days, when it is ready for dyeing, after being
thoroughly washed.</p>


<h3>IRON</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>Ferrous Sulphate, copperas, green vitriol.</i>)</p>

<p>Iron is one of the oldest mordants known and is largely
used in wool and cotton dyeing. It is almost as important
as alum. The temperature of the mordanting bath must be
raised very gradually to boiling point or the wool will dye
unevenly. A general method of dealing with copperas is to
boil the wool first in a decoction of the colouring matter and
then add the mordant to the same bath in a proportion of
5 to 8 per cent of the weight of the wool, and continue boiling
for half an hour or so longer. With some dyes a separate bath
is needed, such as with Camwood or Catechu. Great care is
needed in the using of copperas, as, unless it is thoroughly
dissolved and mixed with the water before the wool is
entered, it is apt to stain the wool. It also hardens wool if
used in excess or if boiled too long. A separate bath should
always be kept for dyes or mordants containing iron. The
least trace of it will dull colours and it will spoil the brilliancy
of reds, yellows and oranges.</p>

<p>Copperas is mostly used for the fixing of wool colours<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
(Fustic, etc.) to produce brown shades; the wool being boiled
first in a decoction of the dye for about 1 hour, and then for
1/2 an hour with the addition of 5 to 8 per cent of copperas.
If used for darkening colours, copperas is added to the bath
after the dyeing, and the boiling continued for 15 to 20 mins.</p>


<h3>TIN</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>Stannous chloride, tin crystals, tin salts, muriate of tin.</i>)</p>

<p>Tin is not so useful as a mordant in itself, but as a modifying
agent with other mordants. It must always be used with
great care, as it tends to harden the wool, making it harsh
and brittle. Its general effect is to give brighter, clearer and
faster colours than the other mordants. When used as a
mordant before dyeing, the wool is entered into the <i>cold</i>
mordant bath, containing 4 per cent of stannous chloride
and 2 per cent oxalic acid; the temperature is gradually
raised to boiling, and kept at this temperature for 1 hour.
It is sometimes added to the dye bath towards the end of
dyeing, to intensify and brighten the colour. It is also used
with cochineal for scarlet on wool in the one bath method.</p>


<h3>CHROME</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>Potassium dichromate. Bichromate of Potash.</i>)</p>

<p>Chrome is a modern mordant, unknown to the dyer of
fifty years ago. It is excellent for wool and is easy to use and
very effective in its action. Its great advantage is that it
leaves the wool soft to the touch, whereas the other mordants
are apt to harden the wool. The wool should be
boiled for 1 to 1-1/2 hours with bichromate of potash in the
proportion of 2 to 4 per cent of the wool. It is then washed
well and immediately dyed. Wool mordanted with chrome
should not be exposed to light, but should be kept well
covered with the liquid while being mordanted, else it is
liable to dye unevenly. An excess of chrome impairs the
colour, 3 per cent of chrome is a safe quantity to use for
ordinary dyeing. It should be dissolved in the bath while
the water is heating. The wool is entered and the bath<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
gradually raised to the boiling point, and boiled for 3/4 of an
hour.</p>


<h3>COPPER</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>Copper Sulphate, Verdigris, Blue Vitriol, Blue Copperas,
Bluestone.</i>)</p>

<p>Copper is rarely used as a mordant. It is usually applied
as a saddening agent, that is, the wool is dyed first, and the
mordant applied afterwards to fix the colour. With <i>cream
of tartar</i> it is used sometimes as an ordinary mordant before
dyeing, but the colours so produced have no advantage
over colours mordanted by easier methods.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h2>BRITISH DYE PLANTS</h2>


<p>On the introduction of foreign dye woods and other
dyes during the 17th and 18th centuries, the native
dye plants were rapidly displaced, except in some out
of the way places such as the Highlands and parts of Ireland.
Some of these British dye plants had been used from early
historical times for dyeing. Some few are still in use in
commercial dye work (pear, sloe, and a few others); but
their disuse was practically completed during the 19th
century, when the chemical dyes ousted them from the
market.</p>

<p>The majority of these plants are not very important as
dyes, and could not probably now be collected in sufficient
quantities. Some few, however, are important, such as
woad, weld, heather, walnut, alder, oak, some lichens; and
many of the less important ones would produce valuable
colours if experiments were made with the right mordants.
Those which have been in use in the Highlands are most of
them good dyes. Among these are Ladies Bedstraw,
whortleberry, yellow iris, bracken, bramble, meadow sweet,
alder, heather and many others. The yellow dyes are most
plentiful and many of these are good fast colours. Practically
no good red, in quantity, is obtainable. Madder is the only
reliable red dye among plants, and that is no longer
indigenous in England. Most of the dye plants require a
preparation of the material to be dyed, with alum, or some
other mordant, but a few, such as Barbary and some of the
lichens, are substantive dyes, and require no mordant.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h2>THE LICHEN DYES</h2>


<p>Some of the most useful dyes and the least known are to
be found among the Lichens. They seem to have been
used among peasant dyers from remote ages, but apparently
none of the great French dyers used them, nor are they
mentioned in any of the old books on dyeing. The only
Lichen dyes that are known generally among dyers are Orchil
and Cudbear, and these are preparations of lichens, not
the lichens themselves. They are still used in some quantity
and are prepared rather elaborately. But a great many of the
ordinary lichens yield very good and permanent dyes. The
<i>Parmelia saxatilis</i> and <i>Parmelia omphalodes</i>, are largely used
in the Highlands and West Ireland, for dyeing brown of all
shades. No mordant is needed, and the colours produced are
the fastest known. "Crottle" is the general name for Lichens
in Scotland. They are gathered off the rocks in July and
August, dried in the sun, and used to dye wool, without any
preparation. The crottle is put into the bath with a sufficient
quantity of water, boiled up, allowed to cool, then boiled up
with the wool until the shade required is got. This may take
from one to three or four hours, as the dye is not rapidly
taken up by the wool. Other dyers use it in the following
way: A layer of crottle, a layer of wool, and so on until the
bath is full; fill with cold water and bring to the boil, and boil
till the colour is deep enough. The wool does not seem to be
affected by keeping it in the dye a long time. A small quantity
of acetic acid put with the Lichen is said to assist in
exhausting the colour.</p>

<p>The grey Lichen, <i>Ramalina scopulorum</i> dyes a fine shade
of yellow brown. It grows very plentifully on old stone
walls, especially by the sea, and in damp woods, on trees, and
on old rotten wood. Boil the Lichen up in sufficient water
one day, and the next put in the wool, and boil up again till<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
the right colour is got. If the wool is left in the dye for a day
or more after boiling it absorbs more colour, and it does not
hurt the wool but leaves it soft and silky to the touch, though
apt to be uneven in colour. Some mordant the wool first with
alum, but it does not seem to need it.</p>

<p>The best known of the dye Lichens are <i>Parmelia saxatilis</i>
and <i>Parmelia omphalodes</i> which are still largely used in Scotland
and Ireland for dyeing wool for tweeds. The well-known
Harris tweed smell is partly due to the use of this dye.</p>

<p>Other Lichens also known for their dyeing properties are:
<i>Parmelia caperata</i>, or Stone Crottle, which contains a yellow
dye, <i>P. ceratophylla</i>, or Dark Crottle, and <i>P. parietina</i>, the
common wall Lichen, which gives a colour similar to that of
the Lichen itself, yellowish brown. A deep red colour can be
got from the dull grey friable Lichen, common on old stone
walls. The bright yellow Lichen, growing on rocks and
walls, and old roofs, dyes a fine plum colour, if the wool is
mordanted first with Bichromate of Potash.</p>

<p>In Sweden, Scotland and other countries the peasantry
use a Lichen, called <i>Lecanora tartarea</i> to furnish a red or
crimson dye. It is found abundantly on almost all rocks, and
also grows on dry moors. It is collected in May and June, and
steeped in stale urine for about three weeks, being kept at a
moderate heat all the time. The substance having then a thick
and strong texture, like bread, and being of a blueish black
colour, is taken out and made into small cakes of about 3/4&nbsp;lb.
in weight, which are wrapped in dock leaves and hung up to
dry in peat smoke. When dry it may be preserved fit for use
for many years; when wanted for dyeing it is partially dissolved
in warm water; 5&nbsp;lbs. of Korkalett is considered sufficient
for about 4 Scotch ells of cloth. The colour produced
is a light red. It is used in the dyeing of yarn as well as of cloth.</p>

<p>In Shetland, the <i>Parmelia saxatilis</i> (Scrottyie) is used to
dye brown. It is found in abundance on argillaceous rocks. It
is considered best if gathered late in the year, and is generally
collected in August.</p>

<p>Linnaeus mentions that a beautiful red colour may be
prepared from the Lichen <i>Gyrophora pustulata</i>. <i>G. Cylindrica</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
is used by Icelanders for dyeing woollen stuffs a brownish
green colour. In Sweden and Norway, <i>Evernia vulpina</i>
is used for dyeing woollen stuffs yellow. Iceland Moss,
<i>Cetraria Islandica</i>, is used in Iceland for dyeing brown.
<i>Usnea barbata</i> is collected from trees in Pennsylvania, and
used for an orange colour for yarn.</p>

<p>A general method for using lichens is suggested by Dr.
Westring of Sweden in his <i>Experiments on Lichens for Dyeing
Wools and Silks</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The Lichens should be gathered after some days of rain, they can then be
more easily detached from the rocks. They should be well washed, dried, and
reduced to a fine powder: 25 parts of pure river water are added to 1 of powdered
lichen and 1 part of fresh quick lime to 10 parts powdered lichen. To 10&nbsp;lbs.
lichen half a pound sal ammoniac is sufficient when lime and sal ammoniac
are used together. The vessel containing them should be kept covered for the
first 2 or 3 days. Sometimes the addition of a little common salt or salt-petre
will give greater lustre to the colours."</p></div>

<p>This method can be followed by anyone wishing to experiment
with Lichens.</p>

<p>Dr. Westring did not use a mordant as a rule. Where the
same species of Lichen grows on both rocks and trees, the
specimens taken from rocks give the better colours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Orchil or Archil and Cudbear</span> are substantive or non
mordants dyes, obtained from Lichens of various species of
Roccella growing on rocks in the Canary Islands and other
tropical and sub-tropical countries. They used to be made in
certain parts of Great Britain from various lichens, but the
manufacture of these has almost entirely disappeared. They
have been known from early times as dyes. They give beautiful
purples and reds, but the colour is not very fast. The dye
is produced by the action of ammonia and oxygen upon the
crushed Lichens or weeds as they are called. The early way
of producing the colour was by treating the Lichen with stale
urine and slaked lime and this method was followed in Scotland.
Orchil is applied to wool by the simple process of boiling
it in a neutral or slightly acid solution of the colouring
matter. 3% Sulphuric acid is a useful combination. Sometimes
alum and tartar are used. It dyes slowly and evenly. It
is used as a bottom for Indigo on wool and also for compound
shades on wool and silk. For cotton and linen dyeing it is not
used. It is rarely used by itself as the colour is fugitive, but by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
using a mordant of tin, the colour is made much more permanent.</p>

<p>Many of the British lichens produce colours by the same
treatment as is used for producing Orchil. Large quantities
were manufactured in Scotland from lichens gathered in the
Shetlands and Western Highlands. This was called Cudbear.
The Species used by the Scottish Cudbear makers were generally
<i>Lecanora tartarea</i> and <i>Urceolaria calcarea</i>; but the following
lichens also give the purple colour on treatment with
ammonia:&mdash;<i>Evernia prunastri</i>, <i>Lecanora pallescens</i>, <i>Umbilicaria
vellea</i>, <i>U. pustulata</i>, <i>Parmelia perlata</i>. Several
others give colours of similar character, but of little commercial
value. The manufacture of Archil and Cudbear from
the various lichens is simple in principle. In all cases the plant
is reduced to a pulp with water and ammonia, and the mass
kept at a moderate heat and allowed to ferment, the process
taking two or three weeks to complete.</p>


<h4>RECIPES FOR DYEING WITH LICHENS</h4>

<p><i>To dye Brown with Crotal.</i> For 6-1/4&nbsp;lbs. (100&nbsp;ozs.) of wool.
Dye baths may be used of varying strengths of from 10 to 50&nbsp;ozs.
of Crotal. Raise the bath to the boil, and boil for an hour.
A light tan shade is got by first dipping the wool in a strong
solution of Crotal, a darker shade by boiling for half-an-hour,
and a dark brown by boiling for two hours or so. It is better,
however, to get the shade by altering the quantity of Crotal
used. The addition of sufficient oil of vitriol or acetic acid to
make the bath slightly acid will be an improvement (a very
small quantity should be used).</p>

<p><i>To dye red with Crotal.</i> Gather the lichen off the rocks&mdash;it
is best in winter. Put layers of lichen and wool alternately in a
pot, fill up with water and boil until you get the desired tint.
Too much crotal will make the wool a dark red brown, but a
very pretty terra cotta red can be got. No mordant is required.</p>

<p><i>To dye Pink from a bright yellow Lichen</i> (<i>Parmelia parietina</i>).
Mordant the wool with 3% of Bichromate of Potash,
then boil with the lichen for 1 hour or more.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p><i>To dye Brown from Crotal.</i> Boil the wool with an equal
quantity of lichen for 1 or 1-1/2 hours. No mordant is required.</p>

<p><i>To dye red purple from Cudbear and Logwood.</i> Dye with
equal quantities of Cudbear and Logwood, the wool having
been mordanted with chrome. A lighter colour is got by dyeing
with 8&nbsp;lbs. cudbear, 1/2&nbsp;lb. logwood (for 30&nbsp;lbs. wool).</p>

<p><i>To dye Yellow on Linen with the Lichen Peltigera canina</i>
(a large flat lichen growing on rocks in woods). Mordant with
alum (1/4&nbsp;lb. to a lb. of linen) boil for 2 hours. Then boil up with
sufficient quantity of the lichen till the desired colour is got.</p>

species yield beautiful saffron or gamboge coloured dyes,
e.g. <i>S. flava crocata, aurata</i>.</p>

<p><i>S. scrobiculata.</i> Aik-raw, Oak rag. Found on trees in Scotland
and England.</p></div>

<h2>BLUE</h2>

<h3>INDIGO, WOAD, LOGWOOD</h3>


<h3><i>INDIGO</i></h3>

<p>Indigo is the blue matter extracted from a plant <i>Indigofera
tinctoria</i> and other species, growing in Asia, South
America and Egypt. It reaches the market in a fine powder,
which is insoluble in water. There are two ways of dyeing
with Indigo. It may be dissolved in sulphuric acid or oil of
vitriol, thereby making an indigo extract. This process was
discovered in 1740. It gives good blue colours but is not very
permanent, darker colours are more so than the paler. It does
not dye cotton or linen.</p>

<p>The other method is by the Indigo vat process which produces
fast colours but is complicated and difficult. In order to
colour with indigo it has to be deprived of its oxygen. The
deoxidized indigo is yellow and in this state penetrates the
woollen fibre; the more perfectly the indigo in a vat is deoxidized,
the brighter and faster will be the colour. For wool
dyeing the vats are heated to a temperature of 50&deg;C. Cotton
and linen are generally dyed cold.</p>

<h4>TO MAKE EXTRACT OF INDIGO</h4>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">1&nbsp;lb. oil of vitriol (pure, not commercial).</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">2&nbsp;oz. finely ground Indigo.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">1/2&nbsp;oz. precipitated chalk.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Mix a little of the indigo with a small quantity of oil of
vitriol, add a little chalk and stir well. Go on mixing gradually
till all is used up. This should take an hour or two. Stir a
few times each day for 4 or 5 days, adding about 1/2&nbsp;oz. more of
chalk by degrees. It is best mixed in a glass stoppered bottle or
jar, and stirred with a glass rod. It must be kept from the air.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<h4>INDIGO EXTRACT (4 to 6&nbsp;lbs. wool).</h4>

<p>Mordant<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> 25% Alum. Stir 2 to 3&nbsp;ozs. Indigo extract into
the water of dye bath. The amount is determined by the
depth of shade required. When warm, enter the wool and
bring slowly to boiling point (about 1/2 an hour) and continue
boiling for another 1/2 hour. By keeping it below boiling point
while dyeing, better colours are got, but it is apt to be uneven.
Boiling levels the colour but makes the shade greener. This
is corrected by adding to the dye bath a little logwood, 10 to
20 per cent which should be boiled up separately, strained,
and put in bath before the wool is entered; too much logwood
dims the colour. Instead of logwood a little madder is
sometimes used; also Cudbear or Barwood.</p>

<h4>INDIGO VAT (TIN) FOR WOOL</h4>

<p>To 2 quarts of water add 1/4&nbsp;lb. lime, and make hot. Then
add 1&nbsp;oz. indigo pounded up with a little of the lime water;
let it stand and get warmer. Pound up 1/2&nbsp;oz. tin, <i>Stannous
Chloride</i>, in a little lime water and add, together with 1/2&nbsp;oz.
zinc. Add more lime water or tin according to the state of the
vat. There should be a streaky scum on the surface, and the
water underneath clear with a green tinge. Pearl ash can be
used instead of lime.</p>

<h4>HYDROSULPHITE-SODA VAT FOR WOOL</h4>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">2&nbsp;ozs. powdered indigo.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">7 fluid ozs. Caustic Soda solution (SG&nbsp;1.2).</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">4 pints Sodium Hydrosulphite (SG&nbsp;1.1).</span><br />
</p>

<p><i>The Stock Solution.</i>&mdash;Take 2&nbsp;ozs. of well pounded indigo,
with enough warm water (120&deg;F.) to make a paste, and
<i>grind</i> in a pestle and mortar for 10 minutes. Empty into a
saucepan, capacity 1 gallon. Take 12 fluid ozs. of water adding
gradually 3&nbsp;ozs. of commercial caustic soda 76 per cent.
This will give a solution of SG&nbsp;1.2, which can be tested with
a hydrometer reading from 1000 to 2000, the 1000 representing
SG&nbsp;1 as for water.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>Next take 5 pints water, add hydrosulphite slowly, stirring
gently until a reading of 1100 is shown (SG&nbsp;1.1) on the
hydrometer. If the hydrosulphite be weighed beforehand
and the stock of the same be kept free from damp air, or great
heat, for future vats the hydrometer can be dispensed with;
it is simply weighed out and added slowly to the water. If
added too quickly the hydrosulphite will cake, fall to the bottom
and be difficult to dissolve.</p>

<p>To the saucepan containing the indigo (100 per cent) add
7 fluid ozs. of the caustic soda solution, then gradually add
3-1/2 pints of hydrosulphite solution, stirring gently for 15 to
20 minutes. Heat the saucepan to 120&deg;F. and on no account
to more than 140&deg;F.&mdash;<i>overheating will ruin the Stock Solution</i>&mdash;let
it stand for half an hour, then test with a strip of
glass. This should show a perfectly clear golden yellow
colour (turning blue in 45 secs. approx.), free from spots. If
dark spots show, this indicates undissolved indigo, therefore
gradually add hydrosulphite solution (2-3 fluid ozs.). Wait
15 mins. and test with glass strip; if incorrect continue this
every 15 minutes until the glass indicates clear yellow. If the
Stock Solution is greenish white and turbid, undissolved
<i>indigo white</i> is present. Add then not more than a teaspoonful
at a time caustic soda solution until the Stock Solution answers
the glass test.</p>

<p>The <i>Dye Vat</i> should contain about 10 gallons of water
heated to hand hot, 120&deg; and not above 140&deg;F. Add 3&nbsp;ozs.
of hydrosulphite solution stirring carefully, let it stand for
20 minutes; this renders harmless any undissolved oxygen.
Add a small cupful of the Stock Solution, stir carefully without
splashing. The vats should be greenish yellow and <i>should
not feel slimy</i>, an indication of too much caustic. The vat is
now ready to dye and is kept at 120&deg; to 140&deg;F.</p>

<p>Between dips add Stock Solution as required, if the vat
goes blue and turbid add 3 to 4 fluid ozs. of hydrosulphite and
warm up to 140&deg;F. and wait 30 minutes. As a last resort add
caustic soda solution very gradually. This should not be required
if the Stock Solution is properly prepared.</p>

<p>Start to dye with weak vats, 20 to 40 minute dips, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
finish with stronger vats. The more dips given to obtain a
fixed shade, the faster will be the yarn to washing and rubbing.
The yarn must be oxidized by exposure to the air for
the same length of time as dipped. After the final dip, pass the
yarn through a 10 gallon bath of water to which is added
3&nbsp;ozs. of sulphuric acid, pure or hydrochloric. This neutralizes
the caustic used. Wash yarn at least twice in water.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Improvement of Defective Indigo Vat Dyes.</i></p>

<p>If, after washing until clear, the yarn should rub off badly,
there is but one remedy. Wash same in Fuller's earth, and if
the shade is then too pale, re-dye. If, through bad management
of the vats, the yarn is dull, pass the yarn through a hot
bath (100% water, 1% acetic acid) and wash in two waters.
If yarn is streaky, take 10 gallons of water at 120&deg;F., 1&nbsp;oz.
of hydrosulphite powder, 2 fluid&nbsp;ozs. liquid ammonia fort. 880,
and let yarn lie in same for 60 minutes. Wash in two
waters.</p>

<p>The following facts should be carefully noted:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Caustic Soda is the <i>alkali</i> which dissolves the Indigo
White.</p>

<p>The Hydrosulphite <i>reduces</i> the Indigotine in the Indigo
to <i>Indigo White</i>.</p>

<p>Indigo White is fixed on the yarn as Indigo White and on
exposure to the air becomes blue.</p>

<p>The yarn, on removal from the vat, should come out
greenish yellow or a greenish blue. The latter is for blue yarn
and should not turn blue too quickly (allow 60 seconds at
least).</p>

<p>Rest the vats for 1 hour after 3 hours work. Never hurry
the vats. It is a good thing to have hydrosulphite slightly in
excess as this prevents premature oxidization; too much will
strip off the indigo white already deposited on the yarn.</p>

<p>Caustic Soda must always be used with the greatest
caution or the yarn will be tendered and ruined.</p>

<p>Finally, unless the yarn is completely scoured it is impossible
to obtain a clear colour, or a blue which will not rub
off.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>The figures given are for Indigo bearing 100% Indigotine,
therefore in using vegetable Indigo do not add <i>all</i> the
Caustic or Hydrosulphite, but depend on the glass test rather
than on measurements.</p>


<h3><i>WOAD</i></h3>

<p>Woad is derived from a plant, <i>Isatis tinctoria</i>, growing in
the North of France and in England. It was the only blue
dye in the West before Indigo was introduced from India.
Since then woad has been little used except as a fermenting
agent for the Indigo vat. It dyes woollen cloth a greenish
colour which changes to a deep blue in the air. It is said to be
inferior in colour to indigo but the colour is much more
permanent. The leaves when cut are reduced to a paste, kept
in heaps for about fifteen days to ferment, and then are
formed into balls which are dried in the sun; these have a
rather agreeable smell and are of a violet colour. These balls
are subjected to a further fermentation of nine weeks before
being used by the dyer. When woad is now used it is always
in combination with indigo, to improve the colour. Even by
itself, however, it yields a good and very permanent blue.</p>

<p>It is not now known how the ancients prepared the blue
dye, but it has been stated (Dr. Plowright) that woad leaves
when covered with boiling water, weighted down for half-an-hour,
the water then poured off treated with caustic
potash and subsequently with hydrochloric acid, yield a good
indigo blue. If the time of infusion be increased, greens and
browns are obtained. It is supposed that woad was "vitrum"
the dye with which Caesar said almost all the Britons stained
their bodies. It is said to grow near Tewkesbury, also Banbury.
It was cultivated till quite lately in Lincolnshire. There
were four farms in 1896; one at Parson Drove, near Wisbech,
two farms at Holbeach, and one near Boston. Indigo
has quite superseded it in commerce.</p>


<h3>LOGWOOD</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>Bois de Campeche, Campeachy Wood</i>)</p>

<p>Logwood is a dye wood from Central America, used for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
producing blues and purples on wool, black on cotton and
wool, and black and violet on silk. It is called by old dyers one
of the Lesser Dyes, because the colour was said to lose all its
brightness when exposed to the air. But with proper mordants
and with careful dyeing this dye can produce fast and
good colours. Queen Elizabeth's government issued an
enactment entirely forbidding the use of logwood. The person
so offending was liable to imprisonment and the pillory.
The principal use for logwood is in making blacks. The logwood
chips should be put in a bag and boiled for 20 minutes
to 1/2 an hour, just before using.</p>

<h3>RECIPES for DYEING with LOGWOOD</h3>

<h4>(1). BLACK</h4>

<p>Mordant the wool for 1 to 1-1/2 hours with 3 per cent
Chrome and 1 per cent Sulphuric Acid. Wash and dye in
separate bath for 1 to 1-1/2 hours with 50 per cent Logwood.
This gives a blue black.</p>

<p>A dead black is got by adding 5 per cent Fustic to the dye
bath.</p>

<p>A green black by adding more fustic. Also by adding 3 to
4 per cent Alum to the mordanting bath a still greener shade
can be obtained.</p>

<p>A violet black is produced by adding 2 per cent Stannous
Chloride to the dye bath and continue boiling for 20 minutes.</p>

<h4>(2). LAVENDER</h4>

<p>Mordant with 3 per cent Bichromate of Potash for 45
minutes and wash. Dye with 2 per cent madder, 1 per cent
logwood. Enter the wool, raise to the boil and boil for 45
minutes. The proportion of logwood to madder can be so
adjusted as to give various shades of claret to purple.</p>

<h4>(3). A FAST LOGWOOD BLUE</h4>

<p>(Highland recipe.) Mordant with 3 per cent Bichromate
of Potash and boil wool in it for 1-1/2 hours. Wash and dry
wool. Make a bath of 15 to 20 per cent logwood with about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
3 per cent chalk added to it. Boil the wool for 1 hour, wash
and dry. The wool can be greened by steeping it all night in a
hot solution of heather till the desired tint is obtained.</p>

<h4>(4). RAVEN GREY FOR WOOL</h4>

<p>Mordant with 25 per cent Alum for 1/2 hour at boiling
heat; then take it out, add to the same liquor 5 per cent copperas,
and work it at boiling heat for 1/2 hour. Then wash. In
another copper, boil 50 per cent logwood chips for 20 minutes.
Put the wool into this for 1/2 hour; then return it into the
alum and copperas for 10 to 15 minutes. Wash well.</p>

<h4>(5). DARK RED PURPLE WITH LOGWOOD</h4>

<p>(2-1/2&nbsp;lbs.) Mordant with 25 per cent alum and 1 per cent
cream of tartar for 1 hour. Let cool in the mordant, then
wring out and put away for 4 to 5 days.</p>

<p>Dye with 60 per cent logwood and 25 per cent madder.
Boil up the logwood and madder in a separate bath and pour
through a sieve into the dye bath. Enter the wool when
warm and bring to the boil. Boil from 1/2 hour to 1-1/2 hours.
Wash thoroughly in soft water.</p>

<h4>(6) PURPLE</h4>

<p>(For 1&nbsp;lb.) Mordant wool with 1/4&nbsp;lb. alum and 1/2&nbsp;oz. tartar
for one hour; wring out and put away in a bag for some days.
Dye with 1/4&nbsp;lb. logwood for 1 hour.</p>

<h2>RED</h2>

<h3>KERMES COCHINEAL MADDER</h3>


<h3><i>KERMES</i></h3>

<p>Kermes, or Kerms, from which is got the "Scarlet
of Grain" of the old dyers, is one of the old insect dyes.
It is considered by most dyers to be the first of the red
dyes, being more permanent than cochineal and brighter
than madder. In the 10th century it was in general use in
Europe. The reds of the Gothic tapestries were dyed with it,
and are very permanent, much more so than the reds of
later tapestries, which were dyed with cochineal. Bancroft
says "The Kermes red or scarlet, though less vivid, is more
durable than that of cochineal. The fine blood-red seen at
this time on old tapestries in different parts of Europe, unfaded,
though many of them are two or three hundred years
old, were all dyed from Kermes, with the aluminous basis,
on woollen yarn."</p>

<p>Kermes consists of the dried bodies of a small scale insect,
<i>Coccus ilicis</i>, found principally on the ilex oak, in the South of
Europe, and still used there.</p>

<p>William Morris speaks of the "Al-kermes or coccus
which produces with an ordinary aluminous mordant a
central red, true vermilion, and with a good dose of acid a full
scarlet, which is the scarlet of the Middle Ages, and was used
till about the year 1656, when a Dutch chemist discovered
the secret of getting a scarlet from cochineal by the use of tin,
and so produced a cheaper, brighter and uglier scarlet."</p>

<p>Kermes is employed exactly like cochineal. It has a pleasant
aromatic smell which it gives to the wool when dyed
with it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>


<h3><i>COCHINEAL</i></h3>

<p>The dried red bodies of an insect (<i>Coccus Cacti</i>) found in
Mexico are named Cochineal.</p>

<h4>(1). PURPLE, CRIMSON AND SCARLET</h4>

<p>(For 1&nbsp;lb. wool.) Mordant with Bichromate of Potash
(3%). Dye for 1 to 2 hours with 3&nbsp;oz. to 6&nbsp;oz. cochineal.
With alum mordant (25%) a crimson colour is got. With
tin mordant (10%) a scarlet. With iron mordant (6%) a
purplish slate or lilac.</p>

<h4>(2). SCARLET</h4>

<p>Mordant with 6 per cent Stannous Chloride and 4 per
cent Cream of Tartar, boiling 1 hour. Dye with 15 to 20
per cent Cochineal, boil for 1 hour.</p>

<p>Enter in both mordant and dye bath, cool, and raise slowly
to the boil. To obtain a yellow shade of scarlet, a small quantity
of Flavin, Fustic, or other yellow dye may be added to
the dye bath.</p>

<h4>(3). SCARLET</h4>

<p>(1&nbsp;lb.) Into the same bath, put 1&nbsp;oz. tin, 1/8&nbsp;oz. oxalic acid,
4&nbsp;oz. cochineal. Enter silk and boil for 1 hour. With less
oxalic acid, a less scarlet colour will be obtained.</p>

<h4>(4). CRIMSON</h4>

<p>Mordant with 20 per cent alum or with 15 per cent alum
and 5 per cent Tartar. Dye in separate bath, after well washing,
with 8 to 15 per cent cochineal. Boil 1 hour. A slight
addition of ammonia to the dye bath renders the shade bluer.</p>

<h4>(5). ROSE RED</h4>

<p>(1&nbsp;lb.) Mordant with Alum. Dye with 2&nbsp;oz. Madder,
2-1/2&nbsp;ozs. Cochineal, 1/4&nbsp;oz. Oxalic Acid and 1/2&nbsp;oz. tin.</p>

<h4>(6). PURPLE (for 5&nbsp;lbs.)</h4>

<p>Mordant with 3&nbsp;ozs. Chrome. Wash. Dye for 2 to 3 hours
with 13&nbsp;ozs. Cochineal, which has been boiled for 10 minutes
before entering wool. A tablespoonful of vinegar added
to the dye bath helps the colour. Wash thoroughly.</p>


<h3><i>MADDER</i></h3>

<p>Madder consists of the ground-up dried roots of a plant
<i>Rubia tinctorum</i>, cultivated in France, Holland and other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
parts of Europe, as well as in India. Madder is one of the best
and fastest dyes. It is used also in combination with other
dyes to produce compound colours. The gradual raising of
the temperature of the dye bath is essential in order to develop
the full colouring power of madder; long boiling should be
avoided, as it dulls the colour. If the water is deficient in lime,
brighter shades are got by adding a little ground chalk to the
dye bath, 1 to 2 per cent.</p>

<p>Madder is difficult to dye as it easily rubs off and the following
points should be noted.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(1). The baths should be quite clean. Rusty baths must not
be used.</p>

<p>(2). Before dyeing, the wool must be thoroughly washed
so as to get rid of all superfluous mordant.</p>

<p>(3). A handful of bran to the pound of wool, helps to
brighten the colour.</p>

<p>(4). The wool should be entered into a tepid dye bath and
raised to boiling in 1 hour and boiled for 10 minutes or less.</p></div>

<h4>(1) RED</h4>

<p>Mordant with 1/4&nbsp;lb. Alum to the pound of wool. Boil for
1 hour, let cool in mordant, wring out and put away in bag
for 3 or 4 days. Wash very thoroughly. Then dye with 5 to
8&nbsp;ozs. madder according to depth of colour required, and a
handful of bran for every pound of wool. Enter in cool bath
and bring slowly to the boil in an hour or more. Boil for a few
minutes.</p>

<h4>(2) ROSE RED</h4>

<p>Mordant with Alum. Dye with 4 to 4-1/2&nbsp;ozs. madder to lb.
wool and a very small quantity of logwood (1/2&nbsp;oz. to 1&nbsp;oz. to
3 or 4&nbsp;lbs. of wool).</p>

<h4>(3) BROWN</h4>

<p>(1&nbsp;lb.) Mordant with 2-1/2&nbsp;ozs. Copper Sulphate. Dye with
2&nbsp;ozs. to 4&nbsp;ozs. Madder according to depth of colour
required. For yellow brown add a small quantity of fustic
(1/4&nbsp;oz. to the lb.)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<h4>(4) RED BROWN</h4>

<p>Mordant wool with 3% Chrome (see p. <a href="#Page_9">9</a>), wash well
and dye with 5 to 8&nbsp;ozs. madder, bringing slowly to the boil,
and boil for 1 hour.</p>

<p>Various shades of brownish red can be got by a mixture of
madder, fustic and logwood with a Chrome mordant in varying
proportions such as 28 per cent Madder, 12 per cent
Fustic, 1 per cent Logwood for a brownish claret. 5 per cent
Madder, 4 per cent Fustic, 1/2 per cent Logwood for tan.</p>


<h3><i>BRAZIL WOODS</i></h3>

<p>Various leguminous trees, including lima, sapan and peach
wood, dye red with alum and tartar, and a purplish slate
colour with bichromate of potash. Some old dyers use Brazil
wood to heighten the red of madder.</p>

<p><i>CAMWOOD</i>, <i>BARWOOD</i>, <i>SANDALWOOD</i>, <i>or</i>
<i>SANDERSWOOD</i>, are chiefly used in wool dyeing, with
other dye woods (such as Old Fustic, and logwood) for
browns. They dye good but fugitive red with bichromate of
potash, or alum.</p>

<h3>WELD OLD FUSTIC TURMERIC QUERCITRON DYER'S BROOM
HEATHER AND OTHER YELLOW DYES</h3>


<p>Weld, <i>Reseda luteola</i>, is an annual plant growing in
waste places. The whole plant is used for dyeing
except the root. It is the best and fastest of the
yellow natural dyes.</p>

<p>The plant is gathered in June and July, it is then carefully
dried in the shade and tied up in bundles. When needed for
dyeing it is broken into pieces or chopped finely, the roots
being discarded, and a decoction is made by boiling it up in
water for about 3/4 hour. It gives a bright yellow with alum
and tartar as mordant. With chrome it yields an old gold
shade; with tin it produces more orange coloured yellows;
with copper and iron, olive shades. The quantity of weld
used must be determined by the depth of colour required.
Two per cent of stannous chloride added to the mordant
gives brilliancy and fastness to the colour. Bright and fast
orange yellows are got by mordanting with 8 per cent stannous
chloride instead of alum. With 6 per cent copper sulphate
and 8 per cent chalk, weld gives a good orange yellow.
Wool mordanted with 4 per cent of ferrous sulphate and 10
per cent tartar and dyed in a separate bath with weld with
8 per cent chalk, takes a good olive yellow. 8 per cent of alum
is often used for mordant for weld. A little chalk added to the
dye bath makes the colour more intense; common salt makes
the colour richer and deeper.</p>

<p>Weld is of greater antiquity than most, if not all, other
natural yellow dyes. It is cultivated for dyeing in France,
Germany and Italy. It is important as it dyes silk with a fast
colour.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<h4>(1) OLD GOLD</h4>

<p>Mordant with 2 per cent chrome and dye with 60 per
cent of weld in a separate bath. 3 per cent chalk adds to intensity
of colour.</p>

<h4>(2) YELLOW</h4>

<p>Mordant with alum, and dye with 1&nbsp;lb. of weld for every
pound of wool. Common salt deepens the colour. If alum is
added to the dye bath, the colour becomes paler and more
lively. Sulphate of iron inclines it to brown.</p>

<h4>(3) ORANGE</h4>

<p>Mordant with alum with a little weld in the bath. Dye
with weld. Add teaspoonful of tin to the dye bath. Boil in
separate bath with 1/4&nbsp;oz. madder or cochineal to the pound.</p>


<h3><i>OLD FUSTIC</i></h3>

<p>Fustic is the wood of <i>Morus tinctoria</i>, a tree of Central
America. It is used principally for wool. With Bichromate
of Potash as mordant, Old Fustic gives old gold colour. With
alum it gives yellow, inclining to lemon yellow. The
brightest yellows are got from it by mordanting with tin.
With copper sulphate it yields olive colours (4 to 5 per cent
copper sulphate and 3 to 4 per cent tartar). With ferrous
sulphate darker olives are obtained (8 per cent ferrous sulphate).
For silk it does not produce as bright yellows as
weld, but can be used for various shades of green and olive.
Prolonged dyeing should always be avoided, as the yellows
are apt to become brownish and dull.</p>

<h3>RECIPES FOR DYEING WITH OLD FUSTIC</h3>

<h4>(1) OLD GOLD</h4>

<p>Boil the wool with 3 to 4 per cent chrome for 1 to 1-1/2
hours. Wash, and dye in a separate bath for 1 to 1-1/2 hours at
100&deg;C. with 20 to 80 per cent of old fustic.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<h4>(2) OLD GOLD</h4>

<p>Mordant with 3 per cent chrome, for 3/4 hour and wash.
Dye with 24 per cent fustic and 4 per cent madder for 45
minutes.</p>

<h4>(3) BRIGHT YELLOW</h4>

<p>Mordant wool with 8 per cent of stannous chloride for 1
to 1-1/2 hours, and 8 per cent of tartar. Wash, and dye with 20
to 40 per cent of fustic.</p>

<h4>(4) GREENISH YELLOW</h4>

<p>Mordant wool with 3 per cent chrome, for 3/4 hour and
wash. Dye with 6 per cent fustic, 33 per cent logwood. Boil
3/4 hour.</p>

<h4>(5) YELLOW</h4>

<p>Mordant with 25 per cent alum, wash after laying by for
2 days, dye with 5 to 6&nbsp;oz. fustic to lb.</p>


<h3><i>TURMERIC</i></h3>

<p>Turmeric is a powder obtained from the ground-up
tubers of <i>Curcuma tinctoria</i>, a plant found in India and other
Eastern countries. It gives a brilliant orange yellow, but has
little permanence. It is one of the substantive colours and
does not need any mordant. Cotton has a strong attraction
for it, and is simply dyed by working in a solution of Turmeric
at 60&deg;C. for about 1/2 hour. With silk and wool it gives
a brighter colour if mordanted with alum or tin. Boiling
should be avoided. It is used sometimes for deepening the
colour of Fustic or Weld, but its use is not recommended, as
although it gives very beautiful colours, it is a fugitive dye.</p>


<h3><i>QUERCITRON</i></h3>

<p>Quercitron is the inner bark of the <i>Quercus Nigra</i> or
Q. tinctoria, a species of oak growing in the United States
and Central America. It was first introduced into England
by Bancroft in 1775 as a cheap substitute for weld. He says,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The wool should be boiled for the space of 1 or 1-1/4 hours
with one sixth or one eighth of its weight of alum; then,
without being rinsed, it should be put into a dyeing vessel
with clean water and also as many pounds of powdered bark
(tied up in bag) as there were used of alum to prepare the
wool, which is then to be turned in the boiling liquor until
the colour appears to have taken sufficiently: and then about
1&nbsp;lb. clean powdered chalk for every 100&nbsp;lbs. of wool may be
mixed with the dyeing liquor and the operation continued
8 or 10 minutes longer, when the yellow will have become
both lighter and brighter by this addition of chalk."</p></div>

<p>Flavin is extract of Quercitron bark, and is much used for
bright yellow with tin.</p>

<h4>YELLOW (1&nbsp;lb.)</h4>

<p>Mordant with alum. Dye with 1&nbsp;oz. Flavin.</p>

<h4>ORANGE WITH FLAVIN OR QUERCITRON (1&nbsp;lb.)</h4>

<p>Put into bath first 1/2&nbsp;oz. Cream of Tartar. Then 3/4&nbsp;oz. tin
mixed with water (important to enter the Tartar first).
Enter yarn and boil for 45 minutes. In the meantime have
mixed up 1/2&nbsp;oz. Flavin and 1/2&nbsp;oz. to 3/4&nbsp;oz. Cochineal (according
to depth of orange required) with 1/4&nbsp;oz. tin with a little warm
water. Remove yarn, enter flavin, madder and tin, take off
the boil, enter yarn and stir well. Boil 30 minutes.</p>


<h3><i>BARBERRY</i></h3>

<p>The roots and bark of <i>Berberis Vulgaris</i> is used principally
for silk dyeing, without a mordant. The silk is worked at 50&deg;
to 60&deg;C. in a solution of the dye wood slightly acidified with
sulphuric, acetic or tartaric acid. For dark shades mordant
with stannous chloride.</p>


<h3><i>DYER'S BROOM</i></h3>

<p><i>Genista Tinctoria.</i> The plant grows on waste ground. It
should be picked in June or July and dried. It can be used
with an alum and tartar mordant and gives a good bright
yellow. It is called greening weed and used to be much used
for greening blue wool.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>


<h3><i>PRIVET</i></h3>

<p><i>Ligustrum Vulgare.</i> The leaves dye a good fast yellow
with alum and tartar.</p>


<h3><i>HEATHER</i></h3>

<p>Most of the heathers make a yellow dye, but the one
chiefly used is the Ling, <i>Calluna vulgaris</i>. The tips are
gathered just before flowering. They are boiled in water for
about half-an-hour. The wool, previously mordanted with
alum or chrome according to the shade of yellow wanted, is
put into the dye bath with the boiling liquor, which has been
strained. It is then covered up closely and left till the morning.
Or the wool can be boiled in the heather liquor till the
desired colour is obtained.</p>


<h3><i>ONION SKINS</i></h3>

<p>Prepare by mordanting with alum. Take a sufficient
quantity of onion skins and boil for 30 minutes. This gives a
good yellow. The addition of tin will make the colour more
orange.</p>

<h2>BROWN AND BLACK</h2>

<h3>CATECHU ALDER BARK SUMACH WALNUT PEAT SOOT LOGWOOD AND OTHER DYES</h3>


<h3><i>CATECHU</i></h3>

<p>Catechu (Cutch) is an old Indian dye for cotton. It
can also be used for wool and silk, and gives a fine rich
brown. It is obtained from the wood of various
species of Areca, Acacia and Mimosa trees. Bombay
Catechu is considered best for dyeing purposes.</p>

<p>Catechu is soluble in boiling water. It is largely used by
the cotton dyer for brown, olive, drab, grey and black. (See
pp. <a href="#Page_46">46</a>, <a href="#Page_47">47</a>, <a href="#Page_48">48</a>.)</p>

<h4>LIGHT GREY</h4>

<p>(For 6&nbsp;lbs.) 1&nbsp;oz. cutch, 1&nbsp;oz. iron. Boil for 1/2 an hour in
the cutch, then put into boiling iron, being very careful to
stir well. Wash very thoroughly.</p>

<p>These proportions can be varied according to the shade of
grey required; the more iron makes the colour browner, the
more cutch the bluer grey.</p>

<h4>CATECHU BROWN</h4>

<p>The wool is boiled for 1 to 1-1/2 hours, with 10 to 20 per
cent catechu, then sadden with 2 to 4 per cent of copper
sulphate, ferrous sulphate, or chrome, at 100&deg;C., in a separate
bath for 1/2 hour.</p>


<h3><i>ALDER BARK</i></h3>

<p>The bark and twigs of alder are used for dyeing brown and
black. For 1&nbsp;lb. wool use 1&nbsp;lb. alder bark. Boil the wool with
it for 2 hours, when it should be a dull reddish brown. Add
1/2&nbsp;oz. copper as for every pound of wool for black.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>


<h3><i>SUMACH</i></h3>

<p>Sumach is the ground up leaves and twigs of the <i>Rhus
coraria</i> growing in Southern Europe. It dyes wool a yellow
and a yellow brown, but it is chiefly used in cotton dyeing.</p>


<h3><i>WALNUT</i></h3>

<p>The green shell of the walnut fruit and the root are used
for dyeing brown. The husks to be used for dyeing must be
collected green and fresh, then covered with water and kept
from the light to prevent them oxidizing. In the walnut tree
there is an astringent colourless substance which gives a
greenish yellow dye. This has the property of absorbing
oxygen from the air and turning dark brown. It is only the
unoxidized pale greenish stuff that can act as the dye, the
dark brown itself has no affinity for the wool. Acids should
be added to the dye bath to prevent oxidization. Without a
mordant the colour is quite fast, but if the wool is mordanted
with alum a brighter and richer colour is got. When used
they are boiled in water for 1/4 hour, then the wool is entered
and boiled till the colour is obtained. Long boiling is not
good as it makes the wool harsh. It is much used as a
"saddening" agent; that is, for darkening other colours.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The best and most enduring blacks were done with this simple dye stuff,
the goods being first dyed in the indigo or woad vat till they were a very dark
blue, and then browned into black by means of the walnut root."&mdash;<i>William
Morris.</i></p></div>

<p>PEAT SOOT gives a good shade of brown to wool. Boil
the wool for 1 to 2 hours with peat soot. Careful washing is
required in several changes of water. It is used sometimes for
producing a hazel colour, after the wool has been dyed with
weld and madder.</p>

<p>OAK BARK. Mordant with alum and dye in a decoction
of oak bark.</p>

<p>ONION SKINS. (Brown.) Mordant the wool with
alum. Drying two or three times in between makes the
colour more durable. Dry. Wash. Boil a quantity of onion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
skins, and cool; then put in wool and boil lightly for 1/2 an
hour to 1 hour; then keep warm for a while. Wring out and
wash.</p>

<p>BLACK. Mordant with 3% Bichromate of Potash for
45 minutes. Dye with 1&nbsp;oz. Hematin crystals, 3/4&nbsp;oz. madder,
1/2&nbsp;oz. Persian berries. After boiling for 1 hour remove wool
and add 1/4&nbsp;oz. cream of tartar, 1&nbsp;oz. cochineal, 3/4&nbsp;oz. iron,
1/2&nbsp;oz. copper sulphate. Return wool and boil again for 1/2 hour.
Wash in soap.</p>


<h3>VARIOUS RECIPES</h3>

<p>MADDER for BROWN. (1&nbsp;lb. wool.) Mordant with
1&nbsp;oz. copperas and 1&nbsp;oz. cream of tartar. Dye with 6&nbsp;ozs.
madder.</p>

<p>MADDER, etc., for FRENCH BROWN. Mordant
with 3 per cent chrome. Dye with 8 per cent fustic, 2 per
cent madder, 1 per cent cudbear, 2 per cent tartar. If not
dark enough add 1 per cent logwood. Boil for 1/2 hour. Wash
and dry.</p>

<p>TAN SHADE. (6-1/2&nbsp;lbs. wool.) Mordant with 3&nbsp;ozs.
Chrome for 45 minutes and wash in cold water. Boil for
1/2 hour in a bag 5&nbsp;oz. madder, 4&nbsp;oz. Fustic, 1/2&nbsp;oz. logwood.
Enter the wool, raise to the boil, and boil for 45 minutes. By
altering the proportions of madder and fustic various shades
of brown can be got.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h2>GREEN</h2>


<p>Green results from the mixing of blue and yellow in
varying proportions according to the shade of colour
required.</p>

<p>Every dyer has his particular yellow weed with which he
greens his blue dyed stuff. But the best greens are undoubtedly
got from weld and fustic.</p>

<p>The wool is first dyed in the blue vat; then washed and
dried; then after mordanting, dyed in the yellow bath. This
method is not arbitrary as some dyers consider a better green
is got by dyeing it yellow before the blue. But the first method
produces the fastest and brightest greens as the aluming after
the blue vat clears the wool of the loose particles of indigo
and seems to fix the colour.</p>

<p>If a bright yellow green is wanted, then mordant with
alum after the indigo bath; if olive green, then mordant with
chrome.</p>

<p>The wool can be dyed blue for green in three different
ways:&mdash;1st in the Indigo vat, 2nd with Indigo Extract with
Alum mordant, 3rd with logwood with Chrome mordant.
For a good bright green, dye the wool a rather light blue,
then wash and dry; Mordant with alum, green it with a good
yellow dye, such as weld or fustic, varying the proportion of
each according to the shade of green required. Heather tips,
dyer's broom, dock roots, poplar leaves, saw wort are also
good yellows for dyeing green. If Indigo Extract is used for
the blue, fustic is the best yellow for greening, its colour is
less affected by the sulphuric acid than other yellows.</p>

<p>According to <i>Bancroft</i>, Quercitron is the yellow above all
others for dyeing greens. He says:&mdash;"The most beautiful
Saxon greens may be produced very cheaply and expeditiously
by combining the lively yellow which results from
Quercitron bark, murio sulphate of tin and alum, with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
blue afforded by Indigo when dissolved in sulphuric acid, as
for dyeing the Saxon Blue."</p>

<p>"For a full bodied green" he says "6 or 8&nbsp;lbs. of powdered
bark should be put into a dyeing vessel for every 100&nbsp;lbs.
wool, with a similar quantity of water: When it begins to
boil, 6&nbsp;lbs. murio-sulphate of tin should be added (with the
usual precaution) and a few minutes afterwards 4&nbsp;lbs. alum:
these having boiled 5 or 6 minutes, cold water should be
added, and then as much sulphate of Indigo as needed for the
shade of green to be dyed, stirring thoroughly. The wool is
then put into the liquor and stirred briskly for half an hour.
It is best to keep the water just at the boiling point."</p>


<h3>RECIPES FOR DYEING GREEN</h3>

<h4>(1) GREEN WITH QUERCITRON FOR WOOL</h4>

<p>Dye the wool blue in the indigo vat, wash well. For 100
parts of wool put 3 of chalk and 10 or 12 of alum. Boil wool
in this 1 hour. Then to same bath add 10 to 12 parts quercitron
and continue boiling for 15 minutes, then add 1 part of
chalk, this addition is repeated at intervals of 6 to 8 minutes
till a fine green is brought out.</p>

<h4>(2) WITH INDIGO EXTRACT AND WELD FOR WOOL</h4>

<p>Mordant 1&nbsp;lb. wool with 4&nbsp;ozs. alum and 1/2&nbsp;oz. cream of
tartar. Dye blue with sufficiency of indigo extract, wash and
dry. Prepare a dye bath with weld which has been previously
chopped up and boiled. Enter wool and boil for half an hour
or more.</p>

<h4>(3) GREEN FOR WOOL</h4>

<p>Mordant with alum and cream of tartar, add to the mordanting
bath a little weld or fustic. Dye with 6&nbsp;ozs. fustic (or
weld). Dye in a separate bath with indigo extract, a rather
bluer green than is wanted. Then put into a yellow bath till
the right shade of green is got.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<h4>(4) GRASS GREEN</h4>

<p>For 1&nbsp;lb. wool: 1-1/2&nbsp;oz. alum, 1/2&nbsp;oz. sulphuric acid, 1/2&nbsp;oz.
salt, 1/4&nbsp;oz. Tin crystals. Dissolve tin in separate saucepan and
mix half of it with 1/4&nbsp;oz. Flavin, add both to the bath together
with indigo extract (1/2 tablespoonful). When hot enter yarn
and boil hard for 1 to 1-1/2 hours. It turns a green when exposed
to air. Wash very thoroughly.</p>

<h4>(5) JADE GREEN (1&nbsp;lb.)</h4>

<p>Mordant with 1/3&nbsp;oz. Cream of Tartar and 4&nbsp;oz. Alum for
1/2 hour. Take out wool and air. Cool bath a little and add half
the amount of the indigo extract to be used (according to
shade of green required, 1/2&nbsp;oz. indigo extract makes a good
colour). Enter wool and stir rapidly for 5 minutes or so without
boiling. Take out wool. Mix in the rest of the indigo
extract. Enter wool and boil for 10 minutes. Take out wool.
Throw away a quarter of the water and add some with 3/4&nbsp;oz.
fustic extract. Enter wool and boil for 1/2 hour to an hour.</p>

<h2>THE DYEING OF COTTON</h2>


<p>The dyeing of cotton is difficult with the natural dye
stuffs, there are only a few colours which can be said to
be satisfactory. The fastest known in earlier days was
Turkey red, a long and difficult process with madder and not
very practical for the small dyer. It had its origin in India
where it is still used; red Indian cotton is one of the fastest
colours known. Catechu is another excellent cotton dye
used for various shades of brown, grey and black. A cold
indigo vat is used for blue, Indigo Extract is not used. Yellows
can be got with weld, flavin, turmeric (for which cotton
has a strong attraction), and fustic. Great care is to be taken
in dyeing yellow as it is not very fast to light. Greens may be
got by dyeing in the indigo vat and then with a yellow recipe,
purples from logwood with tin mordant, but purples and
greens are unsatisfactory, and not suitable to the vegetable
dyer.</p>

<h4>BOILING OUT</h4>

<p>Before dyeing cotton in the raw state, or in yarn spun
direct from the raw state, it must be boiled for several hours
to extract its natural impurities. For dark colours water alone
may be used, but for light and bright colours a weak solution
of carbonate of soda, 5%; or of caustic soda, 2%, should be
used.</p>

<h4>MORDANTS</h4>

<p><i>Alum.</i> Alum (1/4 weight of cotton) is dissolved in hot water
with carbonate of soda crystals, or other alkali (1/4 weight of
alum); work cotton in the solution, steep for several hours or
overnight. Then well wash. Aluminium acetate solution as
for silk (page <a href="#Page_56">56</a>) may be used. After drying, the cotton may
be passed through a fixing solution of some alkali, for examples<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
see page <a href="#Page_50">50</a>. Before mordanting with alum, the
cotton is often prepared with tannic acid.</p>

<p><i>Iron.</i> Iron is usually employed as a "saddening" agent, i.e.
the cotton after dyeing is steeped in a cold solution of the
mordant. A further use is in dyeing black, when the cotton,
after being prepared with tannin, is steeped in a cold solution
of Iron. This process by itself gives a dark colour before any
dye is used.</p>

<p><i>Tin.</i> Tin is rarely used alone as a mordant for cotton but
brightens the colour in combination with other mordants.</p>

<p><i>Chrome.</i> Chrome is used for browns and other colours with
Catechu. After boiling in a solution of the dye stuff, boil a
short time in chrome solution, this oxidizes the colouring
matter of the Catechu.</p>

<p><i>Copper.</i> Copper is sometimes added in small quantities to the
dye bath for brown or yellow to vary the shade.</p>

<p><i>Tannin (Tannic acid).</i> Cotton and linen strongly attract tannin
and when prepared with it they are able to retain dyes
permanently. Cotton saturated with tannin attracts the dye
stuff more rapidly, and holds it. Tannic acid is the best tannin
for mordanting as it is the purest and is free from any other
colouring matter; it is, therefore, used for pale and bright
shades. But for dark shades, substances containing tannic
acid are used, such as <i>sumach</i>, <i>myrobalans</i>, <i>valonia</i>, <i>divi-divi</i>,
<i>oak galls</i>, <i>chestnut</i> (8 to 10 per cent tannin), <i>catechu</i>.</p>

<p>Cotton and linen are prepared with tannin after they have
been through the required cleansing, and, if necessary,
bleaching operations. A bath is prepared with 2 to 5 per cent
of tannic acid of the weight of the cotton, and a sufficient
quantity of water. For dark shades, 5 to 10 per cent should
be used. The bath is used either hot or cold. It should not be
above 60&deg;C. The cotton is worked in this for some time, and
then left to soak for 3 to 12 hours, while the bath cools. It is
then wrung out and slightly washed.</p>

<p>The following gives the relative proportions of the various
substances containing tannin:&mdash;1&nbsp;lb. tannic acid <i>equals</i> 4&nbsp;lbs.
sumach, 18&nbsp;lbs. myrobalans, 14&nbsp;lbs. divi-divi, 11&nbsp;lbs. oak galls.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Examples from various recipes</i>:</p>

<p>
For 10&nbsp;lbs. cotton use 12&nbsp;ozs. tannic acid.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">"&nbsp; 50&nbsp; "&nbsp; &nbsp;  "&nbsp; &nbsp;  "&nbsp; 10&nbsp;lbs. sumach.</span><br />

</p>

<p>Some recipes soak the cotton 24 hours, others 48.</p>


<h3>RECIPES FOR DYEING</h3>

<h4>(1) INDIGO VAT</h4>

<p>Take 3&nbsp;oz. well ground indigo, mix into a paste with hot
water. Slake 3&nbsp;oz. Quicklime and boil with 6&nbsp;oz. Potash or
Soda ash in sufficient water, let it settle, pour off the clear
liquor in which dissolve the indigo paste, boil or keep hot 24
hours; it should then have the consistency of thick cream,
with much froth. During the boiling, slake another 3&nbsp;oz.
quicklime, boil in a pint of water for 15 minutes, let settle,
pour off the clear liquor in which dissolve 4 to 5&nbsp;oz. green
copperas. Add the indigo and copperas solutions to 5 gallons
water, stir well, let vat rest, stir once or twice during 24
hours or until it appear ready for dyeing. Before use it
should be stirred and let stand 2 hours. It should be a clear
yellowish green with much scum.</p>

<p>The cotton to be dyed should be entered in dips of increasing
lengths of time, as 1, 5, 10, 20 minutes, and aired in
between, according to depth of shade required. It should then
be well washed, passing through water slightly acidulated
with Sulphuric acid (a teaspoonful to 1 gallon). When this
vat appears exhausted and turns a dark colour it may be
revived by adding 2 or 3&nbsp;oz. Green Copperas dissolved as
before. When again exhausted, more of all the ingredients
must be added.</p>

<h4>(2) LIME COPPERAS VAT</h4>

<p>2&nbsp;oz. Indigo, 4&nbsp;oz. Copperas, 5&nbsp;oz. Quicklime (fresh).
Mix Indigo into a paste with hot water. Dissolve copperas in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
hot water. Slake lime. Fill earthenware jar with about
5 gallons cold water and add the Indigo, copperas and slaked
lime in that order. Stir well, cover and let stand till next day
or until vat is in proper condition; it should be clear brownish
yellow with possible blue scum. There will be some sediment.
The dyeing process is as in (1).</p>

<h4>(3) RED</h4>

<p>(For 1&nbsp;lb. cotton.) The Turkey Red process is long and
difficult. (1) Boil yarn 6 to 8 hours in a solution of carbonate
of soda, 1-1/2&nbsp;oz., wash well and dry. (2) Prepare a solution of
2 fluid ozs. Turkey Red oil, 2 ozs.&nbsp;ozrbonate of soda at 100&deg;F.,
work cotton in this till thoroughly saturated, wring out,
dry. (3) Repeat No. 2. (4) Repeat No. 2. (5) Steep 3 or 4
hours in solution of 1&nbsp;oz. carbonate of soda at 100&deg;F., wring
out, dry. (6) Repeat No. 5 with a slight increase of soda.
(7) as No. 6. (8) Steep 10 hours in water at 100&deg;F., dry. The
cotton should now be clear white. (9) Steep 4 hours in solution
of 1-1/2&nbsp;oz. tannic acid or 4&nbsp;oz. Galls, at 100&deg;F., wring out,
dry. (10) Steep 24 hours in solution made by dissolving 10
oz. alum in hot water, and slowly adding 2-1/2&nbsp;oz. carbonate of
soda crystals, wring out and dry. The cotton is now grey
coloured. (11) Dye with 2&nbsp;lbs. madder. Bring slowly to the
boil, boil for 1 hour, a white scum on the surface denotes the
cotton has absorbed all its colour. A teaspoonful of chalk
may be added to the dye-bath. The cotton is now dark claret
colour. (12) To brighten, boil 3 or 4 hours in a solution of
1/2&nbsp;oz. carbonate of soda crystals and 1/2&nbsp;oz. soap. The bath
should be covered, except for a small outlet for the steam
which otherwise should be retained as much as possible.
(13) The cotton can be further brightened by boiling with
1/2&nbsp;oz. soap and a teaspoonful of Tin. Wash and dry.</p>

<h4>(4) RED</h4>

<p>(For 1&nbsp;lb.) After boiling out in soda, wash and dry. Steep
overnight in a hot bath of 1-1/2&nbsp;oz. Tannic acid or 4&nbsp;oz. Galls,
dry, steep in cold solution of 1/4&nbsp;lb. alum and 1/2&nbsp;oz. chalk, dry,
add 2&nbsp;oz. more alum to solution and steep as before, wash and

sulphate, boil for 1 hour, then boil with soap. Or dye with
2 to 3&nbsp;oz. Quercitron, which should be brought slowly to the
boil and boiled for a few minutes only.</p>

<h4>(6) YELLOW</h4>

<p>(For 1&nbsp;lb.) Steep overnight in hot bath of 1-1/2&nbsp;oz. Tannic
acid, or 4&nbsp;oz. Galls, wring out, dry. Work 2 hours in bath of
1/4&nbsp;lb. alum and 1/2&nbsp;oz. chalk, dry, pass through weak bath of

flavin to cutch bath, re-enter cotton. Repeat above until the
required depth of colour is reached, finish in cutch bath to
obtain deepest shade, which may be darkened by adding
1 drachm or so copper sulphate. A greyish drab may be got
by adding ferrous sulphate. All shades of brown may be obtained
by decreasing or increasing the amount of cutch or by
adding a little logwood or fustic, in which latter case the
cotton should have been previously mordanted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<h4>THE ZINC-LIME INDIGO VAT</h4>

<p><i>The Zinc-lime Indigo Vat.</i> It will be necessary to explain
these words&mdash;Indigo blue is insoluble and cannot be used for
dyeing. If however it is "reduced" or changed to indigo
white, it has, while it is in this form, an affinity for vegetable
and animal fibre. These fibres will take it up from the
solution and retain it. If they are then exposed to the air, the
oxygen acts upon the indigo in the fibre and turns it back
again to indigo blue. Various chemicals can be used to reduce
indigo blue to indigo white. I propose to describe how
the work is done with zinc dust and lime as reducing agents.</p>

<p>In course of time the word "vat" has been transferred
from the dyeing vessels themselves to their contents; <i>i.e.</i>, the
indigo dye liquor. By "vat," therefore, we understand not
only the vessel used for dyeing indigo, but the solution of alkali
salts of indigo white in water. This definition distinguishes
the <i>indigo vat</i> completely from indigo extract, or any
other improper purposes to which indigo may be put.</p>

<p>The zinc lime indigo vat is better than any other for dyeing
cotton and linen. It is also very good for dyeing silk. It has
many advantages over the hydrosulphite vat, as it is not nearly
so much affected by changes of temperature and weather.
It can be put to work after a six months' rest.</p>

<p>The disadvantage which it shares with the copperas vat,
though in a less degree, is that there is a sediment which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
must not touch the stuff during the dyeing. This is avoided
by hanging a net in the vat after the sediment has settled, or
by dipping the skeins on rods.</p>

<p>It is essential that the indigo used should be of the best
quality, and ground to so fine a powder that it will float on
water. Coarsely ground indigo will never reduce and can be
found at the bottom of the vat unchanged. It should be so
fine that no roughness is felt with the tongue. Buy the best
quality indigo ready ground, and if possible mixed to a paste
with water. A 20% paste, <i>i.e.</i> 20% of indigo and 80% of
water, is a usual quantity. If indigo powder must be used it
must be mixed to a paste very carefully, as it will, if properly
ground, fly about like dust. The easiest method of mixing is
to pour the required amount of boiling water into a jar (previously
heated), then put in the indigo. Close the vessel
tightly. The steam which rises will moisten the indigo so
that it loses its tendency to fly about. After 10 or 15 minutes
it can easily be mixed with a stick. The zinc dust should be
dry and not caked.</p>

<p><i>The lime</i> should be in hard lumps. It should be bought
from a reliable chemist in a sealed container, and kept sealed
till wanted. If it is crumbling and cracking it has been exposed
to damp air, and is partly slaked already, and therefore
more or less useless.</p>

<p>As the indigo is more quickly reduced in a concentrated
solution, a stock vat is first made and this is added to the dye
vat as required. The vessel for the stock vat should have a
well-fitting lid. A stoneware jar with a bung will do very
well. To make a stock vat sufficient to furnish a dye vat containing
15-20 gallons use:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">10&nbsp;oz. Indigo 20% paste (or 2-1/2&nbsp;oz. indigo pasted with</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">7-1/2&nbsp;oz. of water),</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">1-1/2&nbsp;oz. zinc dust,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">4-5&nbsp;oz. quick lime,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">4-5 pints of water.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Mix the zinc dust to a paste with a little of the water, gradually
add the indigo and the rest of the water. The heat of the
water should be not less than 160&deg;F. as it will cool while the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
lime is being prepared. Slake the lime in a separate vessel by
pouring about 5&nbsp;oz. of water over it. When it begins to hiss
and break, add more water little by little. When all the
lumps have cracked up stir till a thick even cream is made.
Add this to the other ingredients in the stock vat. Stir well.
The stock vat should have a temperature of 120-140&deg;F. It
should be stirred at intervals. The vessel should be stood in
hot water to keep the temperature as near 120&deg;F. as possible.
In about 5 hours the mixture has a pure yellow colour
and is ready to add to the dye vat. (There is of course a blue-black
scum of indigo on top.)</p>

<p><i>Preparation of the dye vat.</i> The vessel used should be deep
and upright so that an unnecessarily large surface is not exposed
to the air, and a sufficient space for dyeing is obtained
above the sediment. A galvanised dust bin, or a barrel (provided
it is not of oak or any other wood which contains
tannin), make good indigo vats. Put 16 gallons of water in
the vat at a temperature of 65-70&deg;F. In order to counteract
the effects of the atmospheric oxygen contained in the water
of the vat, additions of zinc dust and lime are made some
hours before the stock solution is added. A pinch of zinc dust
and an ounce of lime, previously slaked, should be added and
the vat stirred. Stirring must always be done gently and
smoothly, every effort being made not to take air into the
vat. At the same time it must be stirred up from the bottom
so that the sediment is mixed with the liquor above it. The
best tool for this purpose is a broom stick, to one end of
which a piece of wood is nailed, like a garden rake. When
all is ready, carry the stock solution to the dye vat, and, to
avoid splashing through the air, hold it in the water of the
vat while gently pouring out half its contents. Stir up the
vat and cover it until it shows a clear yellow colour under
the surface of the scum. This may not happen for 24 hours.
A good way to test the colour of the vat is to push back the
scum with the edge of a saucer or plate, then dip it halfway
into the liquor. Against its white surface the colour of the
liquor will be plainly seen. It should look like good light ale.
If the liquor is greenish and sufficient time has elapsed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
another pinch of zinc dust and a little more lime must be
added as before, and the vat again stirred, allowed to settle
and again tested. A little difficulty may be found in getting
the vat to start, but once it has worked well no difficulty will
be found in starting it again. It will work more easily as it
gets older.</p>

<p>As indigo does not penetrate easily, every effort must be
made to help it to do so. The stuff to be dyed must be
thoroughly scoured so that no particle of grease, size, or any
other impurity is present. Every effort must be made to prevent
unreduced indigo from attaching itself to the cotton.
Never begin to dye in a vat which is greenish. The unreduced
indigo will attach itself to the stuff and be wasted.
Your time will also be wasted in washing it off.</p>

<p>The vat should be thoroughly stirred and allowed to settle
each day before dyeing begins. When the sediment has
settled, the froth should be carefully skimmed and kept to
return to the vat when the day's dyeing is finished.</p>

<p>If a net is to be used it should be thoroughly wetted (if
everything goes into the vat wet it will take less air with it).
The net can be kept down by tying a few stones in a bag or
an iron weight to the centre of it. If the hanks are to be
dipped on a rod this may be of iron, or of wood suitably
weighted. The hanks should not be less than 8 inches below
the surface of the liquor and about 1 ft. above the bottom
of the vat. The hanks should be turned after each dip, as, if
the same end goes to the bottom each time it will be darker.
A pulley over the vat to draw out the rod or net is convenient.
The dyeings can then be allowed to drain a few seconds.
Then wring each hank, shaking it out to get the air into it.
After a sufficient airing, dip again. Many short dips with
airing between will produce faster colours. Dip 1 minute,
wring and air 2 minutes. Dip 2 minutes, wring and air 4
minutes. Dip 5 minutes, and so on.</p>

<p>As linen and cotton look so very much darker when wet
than when dry, a bit should be dried to judge if the colour is
right.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>Indigo can be dyed from the palest sky blue to black. The
very palest shade of sky blue is never very fast. The virtue
which indigo alone seems to possess is that, though it may
become lighter with continual use, it also becomes a clearer
and more lovely blue. This is especially so on cotton and
linen, for which it is a superb dye. The varying shades of
indigo of butchers' coats, sailors' collars, and French porters'
blouses always give us pleasure.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h2>THE DYEING OF SILK</h2>


<p>Silk is covered with a natural gum which has to be removed
before the dyeing process can begin. This is done
by boiling for one hour or more in a bath containing
soap, 2 to 8&nbsp;ozs. to the pound of silk according to the amount
of gum on the silk. It is then well washed, and is ready for
mordanting.</p>

<p>The mordants mostly used are <i>Alum</i>, for most of the
bright colours. <i>Tin</i>, for brightening some colours, and as a
separate mordant for others. <i>Iron</i>, for black dyeing. <i>Chrome</i>,
for certain browns such as catechu.</p>

<p>The principal Alum mordant is Acetate of Alumine, prepared
as follows: Let 3&nbsp;lbs. Alum and 3&nbsp;ozs. chalk be dissolved
in 1 gallon of warm water in an earthenware pan, add
the chalk slowly to the Alum. Add 2&nbsp;lbs. white acetate of
lead, stir occasionally during 24 to 36 hours. Let it remain
12 hours at rest. Decant and preserve the clear liquor, being
careful not to stir up the sediment. Pour 2 gallons of water
on the sediment, and stir occasionally for 12 hours. Let it rest
12 hours. Decant the clear and add to the first lot. Bottle for
use. It keeps about three weeks. Of the mordant 2 parts are
diluted with 1 of water, and the silk is well worked in this for
10 minutes, after being wetted down. Steep for 12 hours,
wring out and dry. Wet down again and return to the Alum
liquor, work for 10 minutes, steep 12 hours, dry. When
thoroughly dry, wash well in several changes of water before
dyeing. For less bright colours one mordanting may be
sufficient.</p>

<p>The mordant is used for successive batches of silk until
exhausted; the fresher the mordant, the better for brighter
colours. Silk should be dyed as soon after it is dried as is convenient.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>
<p>Another Alum mordant. Dissolve 25 per cent of Alum in
hot water and add 6 per cent carbonate of soda crystals. Fill
up a jar with water and steep silk in it over-night. It must be
washed before dyeing.</p>


<h3>RECIPES FOR DYEING</h3>

<h4>(1) INDIGO VAT FOR BLUE</h4>

<p>Silk is dyed in a similar manner as described for wool, but
requires stronger vats and longer dips to obtain the same
depth of colour. See page <a href="#Page_33">33</a>.</p>

<h4>(2) INDIGO EXTRACT FOR BLUE</h4>

<p>Dye at a temperature of 40 to 50&deg;C. with as much
Indigo Extract dissolved in the bath as is required for the
desired depth of shade. If the silk has been first mordanted
with alum, compound colours can be obtained by the addition
of a red or yellow dye to the bath.</p>

<h4>(3) CRIMSON</h4>

<p>Mordant with Alum or Aluminium Acetate and dye with
40 to 50 per cent Cochineal. A teaspoonful of Tin, dissolved
in cold water, may be added to brighten. Boil well. It
is advisable to wash in soap after using tin as it prevents the
latter making the yarn brittle.</p>

<h4>(4) MADDER RED</h4>

<p>Mordant with Alum or Aluminium Acetate. Dye with
80 to 100 per cent Madder and a handful of bran per pound
of silk. Bring slowly to the boil in 1 hour, boil a few minutes.
It should be brightened by boiling a short time in soap, with a
little tin.</p>

<h4>(5) YELLOW</h4>

<p>Mordant with Alum or Aluminium Acetate. Various
Dyes may be used. <i>Weld</i>: Dye with 150 per cent. <i>Flavin</i>:
Dye with 1&nbsp;oz. to the pound, with a teaspoonful Tin. <i>Fustic</i>:
Dye with 50 per cent, or more. <i>Quercitron</i>: Dye with 10 to
20 per cent. A little chalk may be added towards the end.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>The shades may be varied by the addition of small quantities
of madder or cochineal. Orange may be obtained by the
use of Madder, 2 to 4&nbsp;ozs. per pound, with Flavin or Fustic.</p>

<h4>(6) GREEN</h4>

<p>Greens may be obtained by dyeing with any of the yellow
dyes and blueing in the Indigo Vat or with Indigo Extract.
If the colour is thin, it should be dyed a deeper blue in the vat
and then re-dyed with yellow. A strong clear yellow is
needed for a good green.</p>

<h4>(7) PURPLE</h4>

<p>Dye silk blue in Indigo Vat. Then dye without mordanting
in Cudbear.</p>

<h4>(8) ORANGE (1&nbsp;lb.)</h4>

<p>Mordant with Alum Acetate. Dye with 1/2&nbsp;lb. Madder,
2&nbsp;ozs. Flavin and 1&nbsp;oz. tin.</p>

<p>Enter the tin first in a cold bath. Mix Flavin and Madder
into a paste and add to the bath. Bring to the boil slowly, boil
for 10 minutes. Wash in soap.</p>

<h4>(9) BLACK (1&nbsp;lb.)</h4>

<p>Mordant with Alum Acetate. Dye with 6&nbsp;ozs. logwood,
3/4&nbsp;oz. flavin, 1&nbsp;oz. Iron. Mix all together and boil for 1/2 hour.
Wash thoroughly.</p>

<h4>(10) BLACK</h4>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">(1) Mordant with basic ferric sulphate and after allowing
the silk to lie for some time, wash well and soap at 90&deg;C.</span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">(2) Dye with 50 per cent Fustic, 10 per cent Ferrous Sulphate
and 2 per cent Copper Acetate.</span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">(3) Dye with logwood 50 per cent and soap.</span><br /></p>

<h4>(11) GREY WITH BRACKEN (1&nbsp;lb.)</h4>

<p>Mordant with 1&nbsp;oz. Iron and 2&nbsp;ozs. Cream of Tartar.
Boil a quantity of young bracken tips for 1/2 hour. Strain. Boil
silk in the decoction for about an hour.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<h4>(12) BROWN WITH LICHEN (1&nbsp;lb.)</h4>

<p>Mordant with Alum Acetate. Put into the dye bath the
quantity of lichen according to required colour with about a
teaspoonful of Acetic Acid. Boil from 1 to 3 hours.</p>

<h4>(13) ORANGE (1&nbsp;lb.)</h4>

<p>1&nbsp;oz. tin, 1/2&nbsp;oz. Oxalic Acid, 2&nbsp;oz. Flavin. Enter silk and
boil for 1 hour. Remove silk and add to the bath 1&nbsp;oz. tin,
1&nbsp;oz. Oxalic, 2&nbsp;oz. Cochineal. Boil for 1 hour or more.</p>

<h4>(14) BLACK (1&nbsp;lb.)</h4>

<p>Mordant with 2&nbsp;oz. logwood extract, 1-1/4&nbsp;oz. fustic extract,
1-1/4&nbsp;oz. iron, 1/2&nbsp;oz. copper sulphate. Boil for 1 hour. Take out
and rinse. To the same bath add 1-3/4&nbsp;oz. logwood extract,
1&nbsp;oz. fustic extract, 7&nbsp;oz. madder. Enter silk and boil for
1 hour. Wash in soap.</p>

<h4>(15) YELLOW (1&nbsp;lb.)</h4>

<p>Mordant with 1&nbsp;oz. Bichromate of Potash. Boil 1 hour.
In a separate bath put 1&nbsp;lb. weld and boil for 1 hour.</p>

<h4>(16) RED (1&nbsp;lb.)</h4>

<p>Mordant with 1-3/4&nbsp;oz. tin and 1-3/4&nbsp;oz. oxalic acid. Boil for
1 hour. Then add 3/4&nbsp;lb. cochineal and 6&nbsp;oz. madder. Boil well
and wash in soap.</p>

<h4>(17) BROWN (1&nbsp;lb.)</h4>

<p>Mordant with 1&nbsp;oz. Copper sulphate. Boil for 1 hour.
Take out silk and add 2-1/2&nbsp;oz. madder, 1&nbsp;oz. fustic chips, and
boil for 1 hour.</p>

<h4>(18) RED (1&nbsp;lb.)</h4>

<p>Dissolve 1&nbsp;oz. Tannic Acid in hot water. Enter silk and
leave for 24 hours, stirring occasionally. Rinse well in two
waters. In a fresh bath, put 4&nbsp;oz. cochineal. Enter silk.
Bring to boil and let blue colour develop. Lift, and add 1&nbsp;oz.
cochineal &amp; 1&nbsp;oz. tin. Re-enter silk &amp; boil well. Wash in soap.</p>
